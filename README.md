# NYC-Real-Estate-Sale-Prices
### Recently, I’ve been watching a lot of Million Dollar Listing: New York, which inspired me to start this project. In the show, one of the most critical aspects of being a real estate broker—especially on the seller's side—is determining the right price for a property. This process often sparks debate and discrepancy among the seller, the seller's broker, the buyer, and the buyer's broker. I wanted to explore which features of a home most influence its price and develop a model that could predict these factors as accurately as possible.
